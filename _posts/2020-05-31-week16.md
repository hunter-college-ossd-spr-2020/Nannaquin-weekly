# Week 16

No new contributions this week. I've seem to have fallen back into being overwhelmed by issue trackers. I'm really trying to shake the rust off my C++ skills, so I'm going after Cataclysm:DDA issues that aren't json exclusive. 

Right now I'm looking at [#40991](https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/issues/40991)/[#40843](https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/issues/40843), the intersection of their claims are that examining the Fire Engine (e->e) causes a segmentation fault, which I've verified for both their circumstances. I tried editing the display name of the vehicle (inconclusive), and checked the other vehicles referenced in #40991 (one couldn't be found, the other was from a mod and didn't cause a seg fault upon examination).

My intuition leads me to believe it may require debugging the vehicle interaction code so I'm looking into that, right now preparing Visual Studio to facilitate this. 

Also I graduated, both from Hunter and CUNY Tech Prep. Exciting stuff, time to fight the deafening tides of rejections and application ghosting. I'll distract myself from this through practice, contributions, and some group projects over the summer. Wish me luck!
