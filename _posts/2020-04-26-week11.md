## 2019 Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) Data Repository by Johns Hopkins CSSE
We were asked to review an open data project, by the name in the heading, and if we would and could contribute. I'll begin by making the (obvious) observation that it is a large data repository, not a code repository. Given that their information is extracted from official sources, I'm not sure how I'd be able to add anything to the project. 

Out of their 419 pull requests (243 open, 176 closed), only 12 have been merged. I find that highly unusual but then again its a project in a form I am ufamiliar with. Even more strange, the titles and content of pull requests are all over the place (it is likely in part to the lack of a pull request template guide). Even further in the direction of oddity is the content of any given pull request in the closed section. Many are closed without dialogue of any kind, by the requester, with no comment. Some react unusually when there is feedback. Take [PR #2272](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/pull/2272 "Weird") for example, a pull request simply fixing a spelling error. The first comment, by a user named atz, asks the author if they can rebase their pull request, which followed with the author closing their PR. Maybe they have some way of handling pull requests that I am not aware of (more to the fact that they have no CONTRIBUTING guide), merging the PR in some repo between worlds. 

Many of the issues regard errors in the data and formatting, which is unsurprising given the nature of the project, let alone the nature of data itself. There are over 1200 open issues and a bit over 700 closed ones. The closed ones have discussion in nearly every single one, but the open ones are lacking.

But I digress. To return to the initial question, I'm not sure I have the proper skills to contribute to something of this nature (as mystical and cryptic as it is), and if I did have time to work on it I'd probably spend the vast majority of it figuring out how to get involved.

## Government Involvement in Open Source (code.gov and the Open Source Pilot Program)
We were also asked to look into [Code.gov](code.gov), the site that can be described as the entry point to an initiative by the Federal Government to leverage the resource that is Open Source software and development.

### II. Government Repos and How One Can Contribute
#### GSA/code-gov-api - The API Backend of code.gov
Ways to Contribute:
* Report bugs & feature requests
* Join the mailing list (unsure how that counts)
* Share ideas or improvements
* Create a pull request with new functionality or bug fixes
* Improve or make documentation
* Improve unit and integration testing
* "Triage tickets and review patches triaging-tickets made by other users"

#### GSA/code-gov-front-end - The Front End of code.gov
Ways to Contribute:
 * Practically a cut and paste of whats above.
 
#### GSA/usagov_lambda - "Lambda functions used by usa.gov"
 * The README is empty
 * No contributing docs
 * Recently active
 
#### Other Observations
 * There are ALOT of repos under the GSA organization on Github, many with cryptic names and little explanation otherwise.
 * Those first two repos seem like real contenders for things I'd want to contribute to, especially due to how much javascript comprises both repos.
 
### My Feelings about the Government's Initiative
It appears that the federal government is trying to better utilize the (abstract) resource that is open source software. Paraphrasing from the site's about page:

* "The Open Source Pilot Program mandates that federal angencies release at least twenty percent of *new custom-developed Federal source code* to the public." 
 * "By making source code available for sharing and re-use across federal agencies, we can *avoid duplicative custom software purchases* and promote innovation and collaboration across federal agencies."
 * "By opening more of our code to minds inside and outside of the government, we can enable them to work together to ensure that the code is reliable and effective in furthering our national objectives."
 
 So at face value it seems like the government is trying to save some money and leverage the perks of open source development (citing that one rule about many eyes and shallow bugs).
