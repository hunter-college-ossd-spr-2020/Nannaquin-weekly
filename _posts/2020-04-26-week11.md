## 2019 Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) Data Repository by Johns Hopkins CSSE
We were asked to review an open data project, by the name in the heading, and if we would and could contribute. I'll begin by making the (obvious) observation that it is a large data repository, not a code repository. Given that their information is extracted from official sources, I'm not sure how I'd be able to add anything to the project. 

Out of their 419 pull requests (243 open, 176 closed), only 12 have been merged. I find that highly unusual but then again its a project in a form I am ufamiliar with. Even more strange, the titles and content of pull requests are all over the place (it is likely in part to the lack of a pull request template guide). Even further in the direction of oddity is the content of any given pull request in the closed section. Many are closed without dialogue of any kind, by the requester, with no comment. Some react unusually when there is feedback. Take [PR #2272](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/pull/2272 "Weird") for example, a pull request simply fixing a spelling error. The first comment, by a user named atz, asks the author if they can rebase their pull request, which followed with the author closing their PR. Maybe they have some way of handling pull requests that I am not aware of (more to the fact that they have no CONTRIBUTING guide), merging the PR in some repo between worlds. 

Many of the issues regard errors in the data and formatting, which is unsurprising given the nature of the project, let alone the nature of data itself. There are over 1200 open issues and a bit over 700 closed ones. The closed ones have discussion in nearly every single one, but the open ones are lacking.

But I digress. To return to the initial question, I'm not sure I have the proper skills to contribute to something of this nature (as mystical and cryptic as it is), and if I did have time to work on it I'd probably spend the vast majority of it figuring out how to get involved.

## Government Involvement in Open Source (code.gov and the Open Source Pilot Program)
We were also asked to look into [Code.gov](code.gov), the site that can be described as the entry point to an initiative by the Federal Government to leverage the resource that is Open Source software and development.
