# First Big PR and Formatting Changes!

## The Second Thing First
I'm dropping the "Week #" format due to the gaps that may arise in me posting.

## The First Thing Second!
I completed my first big PR today after spending a week researching, debugging, communicating with contributors, maintainers, and issuers (haven't found a word for it yet) alike. I believe I made reference to it in the last post, but I'll link the PR (https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/pull/41222)[here].

From where the issue started I never thought it would take me to where I found my solutions. Im glad I did the work tracing the errors and followed my intuition about how things could've led up to the crash. Fun stuff, really. I got 20+ screenshots for note purposes as well as like 15+ notebook pages filled out with my thoughts, conclusions, and maps of function calls just to keep my sanity in check. First time I ever felt I've done something big with C++ in my four years of learning and using it.
